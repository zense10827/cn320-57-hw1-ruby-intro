1) Basic Ruby Practice
-----------------------

Check the documentation on Array, Hash and Enumerable as they could help tremendously with these exercises. :-)

Define a method `sum(array)` that takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the sum of its elements. For an empty array it should return zero.

Define a method `max_2_sum(array)` which takes an array of integers as an argument and returns the sum of its two largest elements. For an empty array it should return zero. For an array with just one element, it should return that element. 

Define a method `sum_to_n?(array)` that takes an array of integers and an additional integer, n, as arguments and returns true if any two elements in the array of integers sum to n. An empty array should sum to zero by definition.

You can find starter code in `lib/part1.rb`.
To run the "sanity check" tests, run
`rspec spec/part1_spec.rb` 
from the top-level directory of the homework distribution.
The line numbers in the error report will give you guidance as to which
tests failed.


2) Strings and Regular Expressions
-----------------------

Check the documentation on String and Regexp as they could help tremendously with these exercises. :-)

Define a method `hello(name)` that takes a string representing a name and returns the string "Hello, " concatenated with the name.

Define a method `starts_with_consonant?(s)` that takes a string and returns true if it starts with a consonant and false otherwise. (For our purposes, a consonant is any letter other than A, E, I, O, U.) NOTE: be sure it works for both upper and lower case and for nonletters!

Define a method `binary_multiple_of_4?(s)` that takes a string and returns true if the string represents a binary number that is a multiple of 4. NOTE: be sure it returns false if the string is not a valid binary number!


You can find starter code in `lib/part1.rb`.
To run the "sanity check" tests, run
`rspec spec/part1_spec.rb` 
from the top-level directory of the homework distribution.

tests failed.


3) Object Oriented Example
-----------------------

Define a class `BookInStock` which represents a book with an ISBN
number, `isbn`, and price of the book as a floating-point number,
`price`, as attributes.  

The constructor should accept the ISBN number
(a string, since in real life ISBN numbers can begin with zero and can
include hyphens) as the first argument and price as second argument, and
should raise `ArgumentError` (one of Ruby's built-in exception types) if
the ISBN number is the empty string or if the price is less than or
equal to zero.  Include the proper getters and setters for these
attributes.

Include a method `price_as_string` that returns the price of
the book formatted with a leading dollar sign and two decimal places, that is, a price
of 20 should format as "$20.00" and a price of 33.8 should format as
"$33.80".

You can find starter code in `lib/part3.rb`.
To run the "sanity check" tests, run
`rspec spec/part3_spec.rb` 
from the top-level directory of the homework distribution.
